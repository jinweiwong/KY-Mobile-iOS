## About
This app is designed to improve the lives of students at the pre-university, [Kolej Yayasan UEM](https://www.kyuem.edu.my/). 
It centralises and digitises many administrative functions. 
It contains a notice board for Student Council announcments ðŸ“¢ , a Covid-symptom screener ðŸ˜·, a bicycle-booking service ðŸš² and many more!

Two versions of the same app were developed simultaneously, one for iOS (this) and [one](https://github.com/KY-ComputingSociety/KY-Mobile-Android) for Android ðŸ¤–. 

## How it was built
This app was built using the [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) language and Apple's [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) framework. It uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) ðŸ”¥ as the backend. 

## Impact
This app inspired the founding of the [Computing Society](https://github.com/KY-ComputingSociety) at KYUEM, the first tech club ðŸ’» on campus. 
There, students are exposed to Python, app development and competitive programming before entering university.

## What's Next?
In 2021, the Computing Society has decided to migrate the app onto [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a Google framework that supports cross-platform development. 

Stay on the lookout for KY Mobile App v2.0!
